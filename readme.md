## Setup
This tool is designed for Linux users, but it should work fine on Windows too.

1. Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

2. Run setup.sh/setup.bat depending on your OS.

To update the tool, run update.sh if you are on Linux.

If you are on Windows, run the program as usual and run the update option.

### Only tested on Fedora 35 and Windows 10
But it should work fine on other Linux distros too.
