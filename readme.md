# Installation
I'll upload already built executables to the [releases](https://github.com/V1li/H4X-Tools/releases) tab, 
but I'd recommend installing the tool manually by following the instructions below. This way you also get the freshest version.

# Setup
### Linux
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/v1li/H4X-Tools.git`

2. Change directory `cd H4X-Tools`

3. Run `sh setup.sh` in terminal to install the tool.

If it doesn't work, install the dependencies manually and start the application in terminal using `python3 h4xtools.py`.

To update the tool, run `sh update.sh`.

### Windows
1. Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/v1li/H4X-Tools.git`

3. Change directory `cd H4X-Tools`

4. Run the `setup.bat` file.

Setup files will automatically build the tool and install the dependencies.
You can also run them with `python3 h4xtools.py` if you want to.

To update the tool, run the program as usual (Inside the folder!!!) and then run the update `[18]` option.
