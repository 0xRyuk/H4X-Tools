## Setup
This tool is designed for Linux users, but it should work fine on Windows too.

### Windows
1. Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

2. Download H4XTools from the [releases](https://github.com/HerraVp/H4X-Tools/releases) section.

3. Run the setup.bat file.

### Linux
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/HerraVp/H4X-Tools.git`

2. Run `sh setup.sh` in terminal to install the tool.

To update the tool, run `sh update.sh` if you are on Linux.

If you are on Windows, run the program as usual and run the update option.

### Only tested on Fedora 35 and Windows 10
But it should work fine on other Linux distros and Windows 11 too.

If it doesnt work, install the dependencies manually and start the application in terminal using `python3 h4xtools.py`.
